                           Emails, telephone conversations, correspondence, memos, interviews, etc. do not have 
                            entries in a reference list because they do not provide recoverable data.   
                            However, they do need to be cited in text listing the person’s name and the specific 
                            date. 
                             
                            Examples: 
                             
                            Technology is only as good as the people who use it (M. Davis, personal communication, 
                            March 13, 2010). 
                             
                            Mark Davis (personal communication, March 13, 2010) noted that technology is only as 
                            good as the people who use it. 
                                      
                           When citing from the Bible, a reference list entry is not required--only an in-text citation 
                            is needed. 
                             
                            Example: 
                             
                            Deuteronomy 25:15 (New International Version)  
                             
                           When citing a secondary source, include in the reference list only the source in which 
                            the secondary work was discussed.
