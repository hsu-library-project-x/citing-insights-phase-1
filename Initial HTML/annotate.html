NAS 104 Final
1.	There are 573 federally recognized tribes in the U.S.
2.	There are currently 109 federally recognized tribes in California.
3.	Three of my favorite thriving strategies are:
3.1. Protecting Water – Taking  a position against Aquacide. I chose this strategy because we talked a lot in class about how water is life and all the damage that is being done to our water. It’s appalling what is being done to our fresh water sources to make profit. I also was able to relate this to an engineering course I took my first year at HSU. What I learned was that once an aquafer is drained – it can never go back to how it was before because an aquafer is like a sponge; it shrinks when water is drained and then buildings are built on top of it – the sponge can not expand the same amount because it has extra weight stopping it. 
3.2. Asserting our right to Free, Prior, and Informed Consent to any development on our lands & territories. I chose this strategy because we also talked about how a lot of the time projects that hurt everyone, but indigenous communities especially, are done “for the public interest”. However, this is not true! Often the public does not want pollution and environmental destruction in their communities; it is important that the actual public demands free, prior, and informed consent to development on lands and territories. 
3.3. Reciprocate: and live Respectfully. Honor and give back to Mother Earth. Practice fasting and discipline by consuming only what you need. Lower intake; I chose this strategy because this is something that I could do rather easily and contribute to a better world. I do not think I have ever given back to Mother Earth, I have never fasted, and I rarely consume based off need. I think this could be a way for me to change by doing these little things each day. 
4.	T.C. Cannon was cutting edge for his time; He brought back the Indian from the past and put them into modern times. As a Native American artist, he was the first to show his people in art from a Native perspective. His paintings were of Indigenous peoples, including himself, contemporarily. Famous pieces of his that demonstrate his ability to capture Native American’s out of the past include, Waiting for the Bus (Anadarko Princess), Two Guns Arikara, Collector Number 5 (Man in Wicker Chair), and Washington Landscape with Peace Medal Indian. He is praised for understanding the human condition and being able to express the human condition in his artwork. 


5.	Stan Natchez’s grew up in Los Angeles and is from the ShoShoni Tatvian tribe. He mentioned that art has been created for all people for ceremonies, spirituality, trade, utility (4 powers of the world). In his interview he mentions his piece in which there are arts created for communication with a yellow newspaper background, trade with a green money background, regions with a blue map background, and information with a yellow pages background. 


6.	After Reading “The Rights of Mother Earth” the three parts that stood out to me were:
6.1.	I chose Article 1 Section (1) “Mother Earth is a living being”. This is one of the most important aspects of the declaration because it eloquently states what most people have forgotten. Once people can recognize that Mother Earth is alive, they can stop treating her as if she were an object subject to humanity’s whims. 
6.2.	 I chose Article 1 Section (6) “Just as human beings have human rights; all other beings also have rights which are specific to their species or kind and appropriate for their role and function within the communities within which they exist.” I thought that this was important because it reminded me of the Dakota, Nakota, and Lakota way to have nations made up of all living beings, like the Turkey Nation, Buffalo Nation etc..  We have discussed in class that this way of thinking, of respecting other living beings, is sustainable and spiritual. As a result, this makes people happy and healthy. 
6.3.	Lastly, I chose Article 2 Section (2) “Each being has the right to a place and to play its role in Mother Earth for her harmonious functioning” because it declares the problematic remnants of social Darwinism that causes people to become entitled to resources. It eliminates the justifications of the torturing, cruelties, and exploitations of Mother Earth and other living beings. 

7.	The “free, prior, and informed consent” refers to relocation of indigenous peoples. It means that the government or any other entity claiming ownership to reservation land cannot relocate the indigenous population without their consent. This consent must be completely voluntary, with plenty of notice, and after all information regarding the relocation is given and understood by the indigenous populations. In the past and present, indigenous people were forcibly removed from their lands for the benefit of non-indigenous people as well as corporations – this article in DRIPS tries to make it so this does not continue to happen.

8.	Arvol Looking Horse’s message to the world was that we need to make serious changes to how we live for the survival of the next and following generations. A white buffalo is a sign from the creator to the people; it is a blessing that is also a warning. It means that there is going the be great changes. There are stories where after people abuse their way of life (that the creator gave them) all the animals and buffalo disappear. Since 1994 almost every year a white buffalo calf has been born. This is a warning about climate change and that there must be a global change—and it’s going to take all people with good heart and good minds to survive those changes.
